## Space Mission

Space Mission is an old-school rail shooter, the player has to dodge the obstacles and shoot at the ships on the way.

## Tower Defence

A classic tower defence, the player places the towers that cost some gold. If an enemy reach the castle, the player loses some gold, but if the gold would be negative the player loses.

In the version 2 of the game, the enemies don't follow a predetermined path and the player can place the turrets everywhere on the field. The enemies change path using breadth-first search alorithm, adjusting it reacting to the towers placed by the player.
